### Hi, I'm Aparajita! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer working with distributed systems. Currently, I'm part of the Uber team, where I focus on designing and constructing a Search Solution using Lucene.

My approach to software development is all about making life easier for the next person who interacts with it. I strive to ensure that my code is well-tested, thoroughly documented, and easily observable. User empathy plays a big role in my API design process, and I prioritize clear documentation as much as coding itself.

These days, I'm primarily working with Golang and Java, though I also have experience with Python. I've delved deep into various data storage solutions, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Aerospike, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and a few others. You can reach out to me on mail <a href="mailto:contact@aparajita31pandey@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">aparajita31pandey@gmail.com</a> or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Aparajta)! 
 
## Challenges 

Since early this year, I have discovered the joy of solving coding challenges with a strong community presense. 

If you know about any challenge that I should try, please write to me! 

## Write 

 I've realized that writing really helps me grasp things better and makes everything clearer. So, after scrolling through loads of blogs over the years, I've finally jumped in and started writing for them myself.

 Oh, and by the way, keep an eye out for my upcoming Uber blog focused on engineering. It's gonna be awesome! Stay tuned!
