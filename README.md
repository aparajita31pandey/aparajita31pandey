### Hi, I'm Aparajita! ðŸ‘‹

A backend engineer working with distributed systems. I currently work at Uber, designing, building and maintaining the APIs that power the company's Cloud product. 

I am focused on writing software that isnâ€™t a pain in the ass for the next person who works with it or rather less crudely put, is well tested, documented and observable. I believe user empathy is an important consideration while designing APIs. I try to stay away from premature optimisation and consider writing documentation as important as development.

I mainly work with Golang these days, briefly explored Rust and have Python experience. 



## Challenges 

Since late last year, I have discovered the joy of solving coding challenges with a strong community presense. 



If you know about more challenges that I should try, please write to me! 

## Write 

I believe writing cements understanding and boosts clarity. Some of my select posts:
